                <li>You are presented with a word cloud i.e. the image with lots of words.</li>
                <li>All the words are related to each other and are based off one theme.</li>
                <li>You have to predict a new word (the one not already in the cloud),
                    that you think best belongs in the cloud.</li>

            <h2 class="section-heading">About This Game:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This is one of the three different versions of this we're working on.</li>
                <li>Currently the game is barely 20% complete.</li>
                <li>All the word clouds are generated using NLP
                    (Natural Language Processing) techniques.</li>
                </li>
                <li>We processed 9K medium articles and utilized
                    about 120K unique words from the articles to cluster the
                    ones that best relate to each other.</li>
                <li>These clusters were then used to generate the word clouds.</li>
                <li>We currently have just 30 word clusters, but these are 
                    good enough for testing this very early build.</li>
                <li>Our plan is to add hundreds of new clusters, as well as 
                    a lot of cool functionality.</li>
                <li>That requires processing of scores of times more articles and hence words.</li>
                <li>But currently we severely lack in resources.</li>
                <li>And that's the very reason why this game lacks in so much
                    potential dynamic functionality.
                </li>
                <li>But we'll try our best to get it done in the next few weeks.</li>
                <li>If you have any feedback please let us know, we'll love to hear it to improve ourselves and this game.</li>
                <li class="highlight-text">Oh and one important thing, we'll be making this game entirely open-source as soon as it reaches completion.</li>
                <p>btw there's no we, it's just me... all alone :( 
                    I'm using "we" because it sounds more professional.

                <li>Hi, I'm Khawaja Abaid, a Computer Science graduate.</li>
                <li>I'm really love Machine Learning especially NLP and CNNs, and Data Science.</li>
                <li>I have almost zero experience with building websites,
                    but I like to learn new things, and I'm really into games as well.
                    hence this website and this game.
                </li>
                <li>I'm currently working on a few other personal ML / DataScience projects as well,
                    and writing a few articles that will be published soon.
