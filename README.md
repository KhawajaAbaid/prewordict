Predict a word that belongs to the cloud (GAME)

## Demo Gameplay:
![predowrict_demo](https://github.com/KhawajaAbaid/prewordict/blob/main/demo/prewordict-demo.gif?raw=true)

- ## Rules:
  - You are presented with a word cloud i.e. the image with lots of words.
  - All the words are related to each other and are based off one theme.
  - You have to predict a new word (the one not already in the cloud), that you think best belongs in the cloud.
  - If you're curious how this game works, then please check the About This Game section below.

- ## About this Game and its Future:
  - This is one of the three different versions of this game I have planned and working on.
  - Currently the game is barely 20% complete.
  - All the word clouds are generated using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques, specifically TFIDF, SVD, KMeans and WordCloud (library).
  - About 9K medium articles ([dataset here on kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabiochiusano/medium-articles/ "fabiochiusano/medium-articles/") were processed and about 120K unique words were utilized from the articles to cluster the ones that best relate to each other.
  - These clusters were then used to generate the word clouds.
  - The game currently have just 30 word clusters, but these are good enough for testing this very early build.
  - My plan is to add hundreds of new clusters, as well as a lot of cool functionality.
  - That requires processing of scores of times more articles and hence words.
  - But currently I severely lack in resources. Cant even rent a cloud to host my scripts. I'm broke af.
  - And that's the very reason why this game lacks in so much potential dynamic functionality.
  - And maybe if a land a job miraculously, I'll be able to fund my projects but for now, I'll keep doing what I can!

*If you have any feedback please let us know, I'll love to hear it to improve myself and this game.
